This is the first and only *individual* (as opposed to *team*) this semester. 

Term: Spring 2020

+ Projec title: 1970s-2010s: How Has Music Changed Over the 6 Decades?

+ Project summary: In the project, I analyzed how lyrics changed over time. First, I did descriptive analysis to the data by decade and by genre. Then, I used barplot, wordcloud and shiny-app to analyze the word frequency of lyrics. Finally, I did sentiment analysis on lyrics.
